## 📖 Abstract

In this report, we introduce **UltraShape 1.0**, a scalable 3D diffusion framework for high-fidelity 3D geometry generation. The proposed approach adopts a **two-stage generation pipeline**: a coarse global structure is first synthesized and then refined to produce detailed, high-quality geometry.

To support reliable 3D generation, we develop a comprehensive data processing pipeline that includes a novel **watertight processing method** and **high-quality data filtering**. This pipeline improves the geometric quality of publicly available 3D datasets by removing low-quality samples, filling holes, and thickening thin structures, while preserving fine-grained geometric details. 

To enable fine-grained geometry refinement, we decouple spatial localization from geometric detail synthesis in the diffusion process. We achieve this by performing **voxel-based refinement** at fixed spatial locations, where voxel queries derived from coarse geometry provide explicit positional anchors encoded via **RoPE**, allowing the diffusion model to focus on synthesizing local geometric details within a reduced, structured solution space.

Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UltraShape 1.0 performs competitively with existing open-source methods in both data processing quality and geometry generation.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### 1. Environment Setup

The easiest way is to run the provided script, which handles everything automatically:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/UltraShape-1.0.git
cd UltraShape-1.0
bash scripts/install_env.sh
```

Or install manually, step by step:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/UltraShape-1.0.git
cd UltraShape-1.0

# 1. Create and activate the environment
conda create -y -n ultrashape python=3.10
conda activate ultrashape

# 2. Install CUDA 12.8 development toolkit
conda install -y -c nvidia/label/cuda-12.8.0 \
  cuda-compiler cuda-cudart-dev cuda-libraries-dev

# 3. Install PyTorch (CUDA 12.8)
pip install torch==2.7.0 torchvision==0.22.0 torchaudio==2.7.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128

# 4. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Install CUDA extension packages (require torch to be visible at build time)
pip install diso==0.1.4 --no-build-isolation
pip install flash_attn==2.8.3 --no-build-isolation
pip install deepspeed --no-build-isolation
pip install sageattention==1.0.6 --no-build-isolation

# 6. Install cubvh (required for MC acceleration)
pip install git+https://github.com/ashawkey/cubvh --no-build-isolation

# 7. For Training & Sampling (optional)
pip install --no-build-isolation "git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git@stable"
pip install torch-cluster -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.7.0+cu128.html
```
⬇️ Model Weights

Please download the pre-trained weights from Hugging Face [ [infinith/UltraShape](https://huggingface.co/infinith/UltraShape/tree/main) ] and place them in your checkpoint directory (e.g., ./checkpoints/).


### 2. Generate Coarse Mesh

First, use Hunyuan3D-2.1 to generate a coarse mesh from your input image.

Repository: [Tencent-Hunyuan/Hunyuan3D-2.1](https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/Hunyuan3D-2.1)

Follow the instructions in the Hunyuan3D-2.1 repository to obtain the initial mesh file (e.g., .glb or .obj).

### 3. Generate Refined Mesh

Once you have the coarse mesh, use the provided script to run the refinement stage.

Run the inference script:
```bash
sh scripts/run.sh
```

**image**: Path to the reference image.

**mesh**: Path to the coarse mesh.

**output_dir**: Directory to save the refined result.

**ckpt**: Path to the downloaded UltraShape checkpoint.

**step**: the number of DiT inference sampling steps. The default is 50, and it can be reduced to 12 to speed up generation.

*Alternatively, you can run the gradio app for interactive inference:*
```bash
python scripts/gradio_app.py --ckpt <path_to_checkpoint>
```

#### Low VRAM
1. Use a low value for num_latents (Try 8192)
2. Use a low chunk_size (Try 2048)
3. Try the --low_vram arg in gradio_app.py and infer_dit_refine.py

### 4. Data Preparation & Training

First, prepare the data, including watertight meshes and rendered images.
Then, run the sampling script as follows:
```
python scripts/sampling.py \
    --mesh_json data/mesh_paths.json \
    --output_dir data/sample
```

Here, mesh_json is a list containing the file paths of the watertight meshes.


The multi-node training script is:
```
sh train.sh [node_idx]
```

**training_data_list**: the folder containing train.json and val.json, which store the ID lists for datasets.

**sample_pcd_dir**: the directory containing the sampled .npz files.

**image_data_json**: the file paths of the rendered images.

You can switch between VAE and DiT training in train.sh, and specify the output directory and configuration file there as well.
